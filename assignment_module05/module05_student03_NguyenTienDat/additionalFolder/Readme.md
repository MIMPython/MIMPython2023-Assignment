# MIMPython2023-Assignment
My name is [Nguyen Tien Dat](https://www.facebook.com/tiendatDS), and I am currently a student at Hanoi University of Science ([HUS](https://hus.vnu.edu.vn/)). My major is *Mathematics and Computer Science*, which is a cross-discipline between applied mathematics and computer science.

This is a repository for the exercises in the [***MIMPython***](https://mimpython.github.io/) group, a self-study group with guidance from students in the school.
